            *An IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement) is subject to acceptance. Debt write off applies to unsecured debts and on completion of an IVA. In some IVAâs up to 80% of the debt can be written off. The amount written off will depend on your circumstances, income, assets and the current write-off policy of your creditors. Levels between 25% and 70% are realistic, depending on your ability to repay. An IVA is a form of Insolvency.

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2>Debt Management Pros and Cons</h2>
        <p>What are the Advantages of a Debt Management Plan?</p>
        <p>A debt management plan will give you the satisfaction that you are paying ALL your debts. You will no longer need to juggle your payments and worry about those unexpected bills that life tends to throw at you</p>

        <p>
            Other Advantages:<br>
            - You will have one payment each month.<br>
            - You will no longer need to communicate directly with your existing creditors<br>
            - Your chosen debt management company will request that interest and charges are frozen. This will stop your debts growing, enabling you to pay back the money you have borrowed.
        </p>

        <p>What are the Disadvantages of a Debt Management Plan?</p>
        <p>
            There are some disadvantages with a Debt Management Plan.<br>
            - If your creditors refuse to freeze or lower your interest, paying a reduced amount over a longer period could increase the amount you repay.<br>
            - You will pay a fee for the services provised. There are companies which can do the same job for free. You can get more information at <a href="http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk">www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk</a>
            - You are still required to repay in full any items of credit that are not included in your debt management plan.<br>
            - A Debt Management Plan will affect your credit rating in the medium to long term. As you are repaying your debts at a reduced rate, your lenders are legally obliged to send you a Default Notice to say your account is in arrears. A Default Notice will remain on your credit file for 6 years.
        </p>

        <h2>IVA Pros and Cons</h2>
        <b>INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS</b><br>
        <p>
            An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a legally binding agreement between you and your unsecured creditors, arranged and supervised by a Licensed Insolvency Practitioner (IP). In short you agree to pay back the maximum you can afford over a specified period of time, usually 5 years, at the end of which period your creditors agree to write of any remaining balances.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IP will work with you to calculate the maximum monthly payment you are able to make and also assess whether you have anything else you are able to offer to your creditors to enhance the agreement e.g. from the sale of an asset or savings.
        </p>
        <p>
            An IP will advise you on the terms of the agreement to maximise the chances of acceptance by your creditors and will assist you in preparing the legal document.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not charge you for advice about an IVA or for help with the preparation of the documents. If you are in a debt management plan already it will continue as normal until your IVA has been approved.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our partners do charge fees for the work both for getting the agreement approved by your creditors and for monitoring it, but these fees are agreed by your creditors and are taken out of the payments made by you once the arrangement has been approved, so you do not pay anything extra to cover the fees. However, the creditors allow the IP to take their fees before they make payments to them which means that if you did find yourself with sufficient funds to pay your creditors in full, because they take a fee first, you would need to pay these fees in addition to the payments to your creditors.
        </p>

        <b>IS AN IVA THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR YOU?</b><br>
        <p>
            An IVA is a form of insolvency and is a legally binding agreement therefore it is important that you consider whether:
        </p>
        <p>
            - You feel able to commit to a regular payment for the next 5 years<br>
            - You may be able to resolve your financial problems without the need for a formal arrangement e.g. if you are expecting a pay rise or could sell an asset to pay your debts<br>
            - You are willing to be open and honest with your creditors about everything that you owe and all of the assets that you have<br>
            - You are willing to provide the Insolvency Practitioner with copies of your wage slips or other proof of income each year. A review of income and expenditure is usually a required term of the agreement.<br>
            - You are in financial difficulty and cannot make the required payments to your creditors<br>
        </p>

        <b>ADVANTAGES</b><br>
        <p>
            - You will pay an amount that you can afford over a limited period; usually 5 or 6 years<br>
            - Provided that you fulfill the terms of your IVA, the remainder of your debts will be written off at the end of the term<br>
            - Your creditors cannot pursue you for the debts once the IVA is agreed<br>
            - Your creditors cannot apply interest or charges to your debts<br>
            - If you are a homeowner, you will usually be able to remain in your home
        </p>

        <b>DISADVANTAGES</b><br>
        <p>
            - It is a formal agreement; if you fail to keep to your side of the agreement the arrangement may fail and you may find yourself owing as much as you did at the start<br>
            - The arrangement must be recorded on the Insolvency Register<br>
            - If you have a property, the creditors will expect you to try to remortgage towards the end of the agreement to release funds to be paid in to the IVA. If you are unable to do so the arrangement may be extended for a further 12 months.<br>
            - Some debts such as mortgages, secured loans, taxes and fines cannot be included in an IVA so you will remain responsible for paying these<br>
            - You cannot take out further borrowing during the course of the arrangement<br>
            - If your situation changes for the better you will be expected to pay more to your creditors
        </p>

        <b>SERVICES FOR SCOTTISH RESIDENTS</b><br>
        <p>
            If you live in Scotland, the debt solutions available to you are different.
        </p>

        <b>DEBT ARRANGEMENT SCHEME</b><br>
        <p>
            As part of a Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS), a Debt Payment Programme (DPP) allows you to repay your debts by making one monthly payment of the amount which you have left over each month after paying your essential bills and expenses. You will pay this amount until the debts are cleared, provided that this will happen within a reasonable period.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your creditors cannot contact you about payments or arrears if you are the subject of a DPP, and they will have to freeze interest and charges on your debts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your details will appear on the DAS register and your credit rating will uauslly be affected for 6 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            You cannot apply directly for a DPP, this can only be done by an approved money adviser. We can refer you to an approved money advisor or you can find a money adviser local to you using this link.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like us to pass your details to an approved money adviser, please call us or fill in the contact form and we will call you back to obtain the relevant information.
        </p>
        <p>
            This solution is only available to you if you live in Scotland.
        </p>

        <b>PROTECTED TRUST DEED</b><br>
        <p>
            A trust deed is a form of insolvency. You can only apply for a trust deed if your unsecured debts are more than the value of any assets that you have. A trust deed usually lasts for 3-5 years, during which time your assets will be transferred to a trustee and you may need to make regular payments out of your earnings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Provided that your creditors agree to the arrangement and you meet your obligations, your trust deed will become protected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your creditors cannot contact you about payment or arrears if you are the subject of a protected trust deed, and they will have to freeze interest and charges on your debts.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be restrictions on your spending during a trust deed and you may have to sell some of your assets. A trust deed may also affect your employment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your details will appear on the public Register of Insolvencies for 5 years and will appear on your credit file for 6 years from the date of the arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will need an Insolvency Practitioner (IP) to set up a trust deed. We can refer you to a trusted provider or you can obtain further information using this link.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like us to pass your details to an approved money adviser, please call us or fill in the contact form and we will call you back to obtain the relevant information.
        </p>
        <p>
            This solution is only available to you if you live in Scotland.
        </p>

        <b>SEQUESTRATION</b><br>
        <p>
            Sequestration is the Scottish legal term for bankruptcy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sequestration would require you to transfer all of your assets and property to a trustee who will sell these assets to pay your creditors.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can only apply for sequestration if you owe more than &pound;1500 and have not been made bankrupt in the last 5 years. You must be unable to meet repayments to your debts as they fall due.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sequestration usually lasts for a year, after which period any remaining debts will be written off and you will be discharged.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fee for sequestration is &pound;200.00.
        </p>

        <b>Bankruptcy and Debt Relief Orders</b><br>
        <p>
            If our providers are unable to offer you a solution that they feel would suit your financial solution, they may recommend Bankruptcy or a Debt Relief Order. Although it is not possible for them to administer these products for you, they may be able to assist you in finding the right information and completing your application.
        </p>

        <b>BANKRUPTCY</b><br>
        <p>
            Bankruptcy is a formal insolvency procedure. You can apply to go bankrupt if you can demonstrate that either your debts exceed your assets or you are unable to pay your debts when they are due. There is no restriction on the level of debt you must have to apply.
        </p>
        <p>
            They cannot assist you in petitioning for bankruptcy but you can apply online through the central government website, GOV.UK. You'll receive your decision online, usually within 28 days and, if your bankruptcy is approved, you'll be contacted by the Official Receiver (or trustee in bankruptcy) who will oversee your bankruptcy and will want to know about your financial history.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have surplus income after meeting your essential household and personal expenses, you will have to make payments out of your income for up to 3 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition you will have to hand over any assets you have to the trustee in bankruptcy to be sold to repay your creditors. This does not include everyday items you need for your reasonable domestic needs but is likely to include your house if it can be sold for more than the mortgage outstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bankruptcy usually lasts for 1 year, and once you have been freed (discharged) from your bankruptcy, you are released from your debts (with certain exceptions).
        </p>

        <b>ADVANTAGES</b><br>
        <p>
            - Debts are written off at the end of one year.<br>
            - Creditors canât take further action unless the debts are secured on your home or other property.<br>

        <b>DEBT RELIEF ORDER (DRO)</b><br>
        <p>
            A debt relief order is only available to individuals who have very little disposable income available to pay to their creditors, have few or no assets, and a limited level of debt.

            A DRO will last for 1 year, and once your DRO has ended you are released from your debts (with certain exceptions). You need to approach an approved intermediary for the application to be put forward, and you will need to pay a fee of &pound;90.

        <h1>Solution Pro's & Con's</h1>
        <h2>Debt Management Pros and Cons</h2>
        <p>What are the Advantages of a Debt Management Plan?</p>
        <p>A debt management plan will give you the satisfaction that you are paying ALL your debts. You will no longer need to juggle your payments and worry about those unexpected bills that life tends to throw at you</p>

        <p>
            Other Advantages:<br>
            - You will have one payment each month.<br>
            - You will no longer need to communicate directly with your existing creditors<br>
            - Your chosen debt management company will request that interest and charges are frozen. This will stop your debts growing, enabling you to pay back the money you have borrowed.
        </p>

        <p>What are the Disadvantages of a Debt Management Plan?</p>
        <p>
            There are some disadvantages with a Debt Management Plan.<br>
            - If your creditors refuse to freeze or lower your interest, paying a reduced amount over a longer period could increase the amount you repay.<br>
            - You will pay a fee for the services provised. There are companies which can do the same job for free. You can get more information at <a href="http://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk">www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk</a>
            - You are still required to repay in full any items of credit that are not included in your debt management plan.<br>
            - A Debt Management Plan will affect your credit rating in the medium to long term. As you are repaying your debts at a reduced rate, your lenders are legally obliged to send you a Default Notice to say your account is in arrears. A Default Notice will remain on your credit file for 6 years.
        </p>

        <h2>IVA Pros and Cons</h2>
        <b>INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS</b><br>
        <p>
            An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a legally binding agreement between you and your unsecured creditors, arranged and supervised by a Licensed Insolvency Practitioner (IP). In short you agree to pay back the maximum you can afford over a specified period of time, usually 5 years, at the end of which period your creditors agree to write of any remaining balances.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IP will work with you to calculate the maximum monthly payment you are able to make and also assess whether you have anything else you are able to offer to your creditors to enhance the agreement e.g. from the sale of an asset or savings.
        </p>
        <p>
            An IP will advise you on the terms of the agreement to maximise the chances of acceptance by your creditors and will assist you in preparing the legal document.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not charge you for advice about an IVA or for help with the preparation of the documents. If you are in a debt management plan already it will continue as normal until your IVA has been approved.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our partners do charge fees for the work both for getting the agreement approved by your creditors and for monitoring it, but these fees are agreed by your creditors and are taken out of the payments made by you once the arrangement has been approved, so you do not pay anything extra to cover the fees. However, the creditors allow the IP to take their fees before they make payments to them which means that if you did find yourself with sufficient funds to pay your creditors in full, because they take a fee first, you would need to pay these fees in addition to the payments to your creditors.
        </p>

        <b>IS AN IVA THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR YOU?</b><br>
        <p>
            An IVA is a form of insolvency and is a legally binding agreement therefore it is important that you consider whether:
        </p>
        <p>
            - You feel able to commit to a regular payment for the next 5 years<br>
            - You may be able to resolve your financial problems without the need for a formal arrangement e.g. if you are expecting a pay rise or could sell an asset to pay your debts<br>
            - You are willing to be open and honest with your creditors about everything that you owe and all of the assets that you have<br>
            - You are willing to provide the Insolvency Practitioner with copies of your wage slips or other proof of income each year. A review of income and expenditure is usually a required term of the agreement.<br>
            - You are in financial difficulty and cannot make the required payments to your creditors<br>
        </p>

        <b>ADVANTAGES</b><br>
        <p>
            - You will pay an amount that you can afford over a limited period; usually 5 or 6 years<br>
            - Provided that you fulfill the terms of your IVA, the remainder of your debts will be written off at the end of the term<br>
            - Your creditors cannot pursue you for the debts once the IVA is agreed<br>
            - Your creditors cannot apply interest or charges to your debts<br>
            - If you are a homeowner, you will usually be able to remain in your home
        </p>

        <b>DISADVANTAGES</b><br>
        <p>
            - It is a formal agreement; if you fail to keep to your side of the agreement the arrangement may fail and you may find yourself owing as much as you did at the start<br>
            - The arrangement must be recorded on the Insolvency Register<br>
            - If you have a property, the creditors will expect you to try to remortgage towards the end of the agreement to release funds to be paid in to the IVA. If you are unable to do so the arrangement may be extended for a further 12 months.<br>
            - Some debts such as mortgages, secured loans, taxes and fines cannot be included in an IVA so you will remain responsible for paying these<br>
            - You cannot take out further borrowing during the course of the arrangement<br>
            - If your situation changes for the better you will be expected to pay more to your creditors
        </p>

        <b>SERVICES FOR SCOTTISH RESIDENTS</b><br>
        <p>
            If you live in Scotland, the debt solutions available to you are different.
        </p>

        <b>DEBT ARRANGEMENT SCHEME</b><br>
        <p>
            As part of a Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS), a Debt Payment Programme (DPP) allows you to repay your debts by making one monthly payment of the amount which you have left over each month after paying your essential bills and expenses. You will pay this amount until the debts are cleared, provided that this will happen within a reasonable period.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your creditors cannot contact you about payments or arrears if you are the subject of a DPP, and they will have to freeze interest and charges on your debts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your details will appear on the DAS register and your credit rating will uauslly be affected for 6 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            You cannot apply directly for a DPP, this can only be done by an approved money adviser. We can refer you to an approved money advisor or you can find a money adviser local to you using this link.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>

        <b>PROTECTED TRUST DEED</b><br>
        <p>
            A trust deed is a form of insolvency. You can only apply for a trust deed if your unsecured debts are more than the value of any assets that you have. A trust deed usually lasts for 3-5 years, during which time your assets will be transferred to a trustee and you may need to make regular payments out of your earnings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Provided that your creditors agree to the arrangement and you meet your obligations, your trust deed will become protected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your creditors cannot contact you about payment or arrears if you are the subject of a protected trust deed, and they will have to freeze interest and charges on your debts.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be restrictions on your spending during a trust deed and you may have to sell some of your assets. A trust deed may also affect your employment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your details will appear on the public Register of Insolvencies for 5 years and will appear on your credit file for 6 years from the date of the arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will need an Insolvency Practitioner (IP) to set up a trust deed. We can refer you to a trusted provider or you can obtain further information using this link.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like us to pass your details to an approved money adviser, please call us or fill in the contact form and we will call you back to obtain the relevant information.

        <p>
            This solution is only available to you if you live in Scotland.
        </p>

        <b>SEQUESTRATION</b><br>
        <p>
            Sequestration is the Scottish legal term for bankruptcy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sequestration would require you to transfer all of your assets and property to a trustee who will sell these assets to pay your creditors.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can only apply for sequestration if you owe more than &pound;1500 and have not been made bankrupt in the last 5 years. You must be unable to meet repayments to your debts as they fall due.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sequestration usually lasts for a year, after which period any remaining debts will be written off and you will be discharged.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fee for sequestration is &pound;200.00.
        </p>

        <b>Bankruptcy and Debt Relief Orders</b><br>
        <p>
            If our providers are unable to offer you a solution that they feel would suit your financial solution, they may recommend Bankruptcy or a Debt Relief Order. Although it is not possible for them to administer these products for you, they may be able to assist you in finding the right information and completing your application.
        </p>

        <b>BANKRUPTCY</b><br>
        <p>
            Bankruptcy is a formal insolvency procedure. You can apply to go bankrupt if you can demonstrate that either your debts exceed your assets or you are unable to pay your debts when they are due. There is no restriction on the level of debt you must have to apply.
        </p>
        <p>
            They cannot assist you in petitioning for bankruptcy but you can apply online through the central government website, GOV.UK. You'll receive your decision online, usually within 28 days and, if your bankruptcy is approved, you'll be contacted by the Official Receiver (or trustee in bankruptcy) who will oversee your bankruptcy and will want to know about your financial history.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have surplus income after meeting your essential household and personal expenses, you will have to make payments out of your income for up to 3 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition you will have to hand over any assets you have to the trustee in bankruptcy to be sold to repay your creditors. This does not include everyday items you need for your reasonable domestic needs but is likely to include your house if it can be sold for more than the mortgage outstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bankruptcy usually lasts for 1 year, and once you have been freed (discharged) from your bankruptcy, you are released from your debts (with certain exceptions).
        </p>

        <b>ADVANTAGES</b><br>
        <p>
            - Debts are written off at the end of one year.<br>
            - Creditors canât take further action unless the debts are secured on your home or other property.<br>
            - It allows you to make a fresh start after only a year.<br>
            - You may be able to avoid having to sell your home if your spouse, partner or a relative can buy your share of its value after any debts secured on it have been paid.<br>
            - You can apply online and pay in instalments
        </p>

            - You may have a bankruptcy restrictions order made against you for 2 to 15 years if you acted irresponsibly, recklessly or dishonestly<br>

            <li><b>Trusted third parties</b> but only where you have opted in to allow us to do so and where we believe their products, services or other offers may interest you. These trusted parties could be the following:<br>
                <b>Financial Solutions: </b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Debt Management Companies offering financial solutions such as debt management plans, bankruptcy, individual voluntary arrangements and protected trust deeds. Our preferred partners in this sector are (but not limited to) <b>Credit Fix</b></li>

            <li><b>Our channel operators</b>: whilst the majority of the channels on our Sites are run by us, some of our channels are designed and maintained for us by our third party service providers. We may receive your personal information from these service providers and use it in accordance with section 4 above.  We will only use the personal information we receive from third parties where the relevant third party can show that it was collected and processed with your consent;</li>
            <li><b>the Information Commissioners Office</b> and/or other regulatory/governing bodies, for the purposes of compliance monitoring;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Where permitted by data protection and privacy law, we may also disclose information about you (including electronic identifiers such as IP addresses) and/or access your account:</p>
        <ol type="a">

        <p><b>Who might our panel of debt solution providers share your information with?</b></p>
        <p>Some of our providers will use your personal information to assess your circumstances (including information about any third party who is named on the policy) and verify the information that you have provided before providing a quote to you.  Some providers may carry out checks with fraud prevention and credit reference agencies. Both public data (e.g. the electoral roll) and private data (e.g. your personal credit history) may be checked in this way. Some providers may carry out checks against data they already hold on you, (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies) such as data from existing products, account data, data from previous product transactions, accounts you may hold with them or loyalty scheme data to share with insurers in order to determine your premium If providers carry out these searches, a record of the search will appear on your credit report.  Some providers may also check public and private higher education sources to obtain information about your educational background.</p>
        <p>This information exchange allows providers to verify the information that is provided during the application process (including information about any third party who is named on the policy), and also helps to detect fraudulent applications. These checks are not unique to users of our Services - they may also be carried out if you obtain quotes from other sources.</p>
        <p>If you decide to enter into a debt solution with a third party provider through any of the debt solution providers, the information you have provided to us, together with any further information requested by, and supplied by you or us to the third party provider, will be held by the provider for the purposes set out in that provider&#39;s privacy policy. Therefore, you are strongly advised to read your chosen provider&#39;s privacy policy and satisfy yourself as to the purposes for which the provider will use your personal information before entering into the debt soluton.

        <h1>Solution Fees</h1>
        <h2>How much does a Debt Management Plan (DMP) cost?</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main costs:<br>
            We do not charge for setting up your debt management plan. There is a monthly management fee of Â£35 per month.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) cost â what and how we charge for our services</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding this can be quite overwhelming. So itâs best to split this in two sections:<br>
            a) your fees<br>
            b) the costs you pay to creditors.<br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How much does an Individual Voluntary Arrangement cost?</h2>
        <p>
            There is a setup cost and an ongoing monthly cost. The monthly payment is calculated by the value of your essential bills and qualifying priority debts being deducted from any monthly income. On top of the setup costs there are minimum monthly contributions which start from Â£70 per month but actual payments depend on your affordability and may be:
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The IVA Fees:</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The Nominee Fee</b> â This fee covers the IVA set-up cost which includes drafting of the proposal, arranging the meeting of creditors and other administrative work as part of the process. This fee is usually the equivalent of your first five monthly payments once the IVA is approved subject to a minimum of Â£1,000.<br>
            <b>The Supervisor Fee</b> â This is normally 15% of each monthly payment made to your creditors after the Nominee fee has been paid. This will cover the work of your Insolvency Practitioner to distribute payments, manage your IVA creditors and maintain their statutory obligations as per the IVA proposal.<br>
            Costs and Disbursements â the monthly payment and what it covers<br>
            Each month you will be responsible for paying a set amount to service the debts contained within your IVA. This will be a minimum of Â£70. Other costs, known as disbursements, are paid for additional things such as registering the IVA, insurance (for the money you contribute on a monthly basis) and other costs such as legal or valuation fees should you need to release the equity in your home. These costs are paid out of your monthly contributions.<br>
            <b>An example of the costs and fees</b><br>
            This is an illustrative example, based on Â£31,000 of unsecured debts on a five year IVA without equity in a property while paying Â£300 per month. (Â£18,000 in total over 60 months)<br>
            The Nomineeâs fee (typically equivalent to first 5 contributions): Â£1,500<br>
            The Supervisorâs fee*: Â£2,475<br>
            The Supervisorâs costs**: Â£1,000<br>
            Total returned back to creditors: Â£13,025 (42% of Â£31,000)<br>
            Total written off by borrower: Â£17,975 (58% of 31,000)<br>
            *15% of further monthly payments once the Nomineeâs fee has been satisfied<br>
            ** Bond fee Â£50, DTI Fee Â£15, plus other case dependent costs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How much does a Debt Relief Order (DRO) cost?</h2>
        <p>
            There is an application fee of Â£90. This fee is paid to the Insolvency Service.<br>
            While this isnât a service we provide we would refer you to the free advice sector for more information.<br>

        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Protected Trust Deed (PTD) costs</h2>
        <p>
            There are fees charged by the Trustee for a PTD. There are two types of fees; Initial Trustee fee and a realisation fee (percentage of the amount that is paid in to the PTD). In addition there are also related costs which are called disbursements. These include legal registration costs.<br>
            The fees will be deducted from your monthly payments. The amount you pay is based on affordability after your essential expenditure has been considered in line with the Common Financial Statement.
